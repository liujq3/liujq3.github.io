### Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">

>Poor interface adhesion between electronic skins (E-skins) and complex curved surfaces causes 
severe data distortion.
<br>
>In this work, I developed <strong>highly conformal and bimodal E-skins</strong> via structural designs and 
a modular concept, and implemented a <strong>deep learning method</strong> for applying the E-skins to pulse 
diagnosis.

### Individual Research
<div style="text-align: justify;">

* <strong>E-Skins Design:</strong> Developed four types of E-skins with ascending conformality to finger tips, addressing the data distortion issue caused by poor interface adhesion between E-skins and complex curved surfaces.
* <strong>Device Construction:</strong> Designed and integrated four modules of senor, adapter, signal acquisition and processing, manipulator and servo control for intelligent TCM diagnosis.
* <strong>Algorithm Development:</strong> Innovated a working mechanism, designed a characteristic data acquisition method, and constructed a deep learning algorithm via 1D CNN.
* <strong>Process Optimization:</strong> Achieved high device sensitivity and long-term stability through rigorous performance characterization and iterative optimization of fabrication processes.

### Outcomes
<div style="text-align: justify;">

* An iontronic temperature sensor and aniontronic pressure sensor—both with <strong>ultrahigh sensitivity</strong> (10.52 °C⁻¹, 665.6 kPa⁻¹) and <strong>excellent stability</strong>—were fabricated. 
* A <strong>wristwatch-like electronic skin</strong> was designed, featuring simplicity in processing, short fabrication cycles, and low cost. 
* By implementing a <strong>one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN)</strong>, the wristwatch-like E-skins can <strong>classify 5 scenarios encountered in the pulse diagnosis process</strong> with an accuracy of 93%. 
* Earned recognition as <strong>"Outstanding Graduation Project"</strong>.
