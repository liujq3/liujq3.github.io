<p>How I developed a passion for flexible electronic skin and resolved to pursue this path wholeheartedly is a long story—and I’ve chosen to share it here.
Believe it or not, it was the tale of a man from Shenzhen who spent 160,000 yuan to adopt a dog that gave me the confidence and determination to commit to this research.

<br>
<p>In 2021, I had just enrolled in university, still a young girl with equal enthusiasm and curiosity for all research directions—like an undifferentiated somatic cell.
I kept up my habit of exploring a wide range of topics, and it was during this time that I first learned about the field of flexible electronics.
It was also then that I came across the story of that man from Shenzhen.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Spending 160,000 yuan on an elderly dog?
If he wasn’t a wealthy person, I thought, he must be crazy.
This seemingly absurd yet true story was published in major magazines, including <em>People</em> Magazine.
Click and read the original article here:<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1wKqwDqOTsLCR_YBabsNag?click_id=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><i class='fas fa-paperclip fa-fw' aria-hidden='true'></i>《被拍卖的柴犬登登，以及它经历的荒诞与良善》</a>

<br>
<br></p>
<p>I learned the full story:
Dengdeng was a Shiba Inu who had lived in a pet boarding school for most of its life.
Its owner had left it there for boarding and then abandoned it.
Over the seven years after being abandoned, Dengdeng was always well-cared for by the school.
However, when it turned eight, the school could no longer keep it—partly because senior dogs require more comprehensive care, and partly because the school could not afford its high living expenses.
Dengdeng had to find a new owner through a public auction, making it the first dog in China to be adopted via such a public bidding process and attracting widespread attention.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Mr. Shu, the man from Shenzhen, was an ordinary office worker.
He worried that Dengdeng—already in the spotlight—might end up being bought by profit-driven companies or organizations, which would fail to provide it with proper care.
To give Dengdeng, a dog that carried the kindness and love of many, the life it deserved, Mr. Shu patiently and rationally raised his bid dozens of times before finally winning the auction and becoming Dengdeng’s rightful new owner.
<br>
<br></p>

        title="/about_me/dengdeng.png" /></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
<p>After reading the story, I couldn’t calm down for a long time.
Back then, I still couldn’t understand why an ordinary person would spend 160,000 yuan on an old dog.
How could he be sure he was the most suitable person to adopt Dengdeng?
What if someone more caring could give it a happier life if he hadn’t won the bid?
Moreover, 160,000 yuan could do so much for an ordinary person—yet he had spent it all on adopting a dog.
I thought it was such a waste.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>What I didn’t realize at the time, though, was that the spirit of the story—<strong>“If you hope for something to happen, stop waiting for others to make it come true. The person who wishes for it is the most suitable one to achieve it”</strong>—had taken root in my heart and would continue to influence me.
<br>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
<p>Fueled by curiosity and enthusiasm for flexible electronics, I soon contacted Professor Guochuanfei, hoping he would guide my undergraduate research.
From my words, he could tell that I had chosen this field simply because it “sounded fun.”
I think he was right, but I didn’t mind. After all, aren’t many passions born from that initial “want to try” excitement?
Maybe one day, I would truly want to become a researcher in flexible electronics.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>During my first year in the research group, I was completely immersed in the joy of exploring something new.
I assisted senior students and research fellows with various experiments and participated in competitions.
Amid my busy schedule, I also created a variety of works to express my imaginative ideas about flexible electronics.

<br>
<p>The challenge came when I was about to start my graduation project in my third year of university—a critical time when I had to decide my path after graduation.
Unlike many of my peers, I hesitated for a long time.
That sweltering summer was filled with endless thinking.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Although I still felt curious and passionate about flexible electronics, I couldn’t be sure if I wanted to dedicate my entire future to it.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>That story came to mind again. I saw flexible electronics as Dengdeng in the story, and my uncertain future as the 160,000 yuan in Mr. Shu’s hands.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Flexible electronics has become an increasingly popular research field over the past decade, and I am just a tiny, insignificant figure among the many scholars eager to join it.
Of course, I hope flexible electronics will continue to advance and benefit human society. But my greatest assets are just my youth—plenty of time—and good health.
With only these two things, <strong>what could I really contribute to this field?</strong> I could easily pursue other careers; there are countless ways to serve the development of human society.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Thinking Through Action</strong></span>
<br>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
<p>That same summer, I interned at a new-type battery company. Driven by curiosity, I kept visiting the production line to learn.
The line was equipped with various large-scale machines rarely seen in laboratories, and many workers were busy at their posts.
The company proudly stated that it had achieved a high level of automation.
Yet I wondered why they still had to hire so many workers.
I wanted to find out the reason.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered the key issue:
these large automated machines lacked precise tactile sensing capabilities.
Even though engineers had installed many cameras to help them observe and make decisions, vision could not replace touch in real-world work environments.
<strong>This explained why, despite the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, machines still couldn’t replace humans even for simple tasks like tightening a screw on an automated production line.</strong>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>I did a small experiment:
I imagined myself as a machine, trying to replace a worker on the production line.
I chose what seemed like the easiest task—wiping dust off battery casings.
All it required was a cleanroom wipe, a little alcohol, and the right amount of force to brush off the annoying dust stuck to the casings due to static electricity.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It seemed like a repetitive, mechanical task, but it was far from easy in practice.
How much force should I use? How fast should I move? The workers told me this relied on something they called <strong><em>“shou gan”</em> (tactile intuition)</strong>.
I understood it as a type of work that requires real-time integration of tactile information, rapid analysis of different scenarios, and flexible adjustments—it cannot be done through completely repetitive, fixed movements.
One must first learn and integrate a wealth of practical experience to be competent.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>This <em>“shou gan”</em> among workers is an experience that is extremely difficult to pass on.
In the language of machine learning, it means their brains store <strong>a “private training set” filled with massive tactile data—one that is nearly impossible to share</strong>.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>This gave me an idea:
What if we could design a flexible electronic skin that works for both human hands and robotic hands?
First, it could collect tactile data from humans during work, converting the hard-to-quantify <em>“shou gan”</em> into shareable, standardized data.
Then, using transfer learning technology, we could transfer this data and experience to the tactile systems of robots.
Would this effectively improve the training efficiency of robotic tactile models and further promote the application of flexible electronic skin in intelligent industrial manufacturing, smart healthcare, and other fields?
<br>
<br></p>
<p><strong>I was excited by this thought, but what surprised me even more was that I actually managed to implement this idea in my graduation project!</strong>
Although many teachers had been worried about my plan in the early stages, thinking the scope was too broad for an undergraduate.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
<p>I am not an overly optimistic person, nor am I overly confident.
Before starting my graduation project, I had little background in machine learning, so I also worried that I wouldn’t be able to submit a satisfactory thesis before graduation.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>But that story came to mind again, reminding me:
<strong>If you hope for something to happen, stop waiting for others to make it come true.
No matter how difficult it may be to achieve what you hope for, seize every opportunity and possibility to move toward that goal—each step increases the chance of making it a reality.</strong>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>So I took the leap and started working on it.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>For my graduation project, I chose <strong>“flexible electronic skin assisting traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis”</strong> as my research direction and goal.
In traditional TCM pulse diagnosis, practitioners rely on <em>“shou gan”</em> to detect subtle changes in pulse beats during “pulse palpation” and judge the hardness of lesions during “palpation diagnosis.”
This expertise is not only hard to pass on but also difficult to quantify.
If flexible electronic skin could capture these tactile signals, it would not only help young TCM practitioners learn but also enable machines to assist in diagnosis.
The project involved a huge workload, including material research, device design, and application implementation.
Thanks to the rich research experience I had accumulated before the project, I successfully completed all planned work before the defense and was awarded the title of “Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Project (Thesis).”

<p>As always, I hope flexible electronics will continue to advance and benefit human society.
But this time, there’s a difference—I am eager to be part of this wave of progress.
If you hope for something to happen, stop waiting for others to make it come true.
The person who wishes for it is the most suitable one to achieve it.
I aspire to become a researcher in the field of flexible electronics and dedicate my life to the development of intelligent flexible electronic skin.
