However, most current studies still train related DL models using the direct learning paradigm based on their own interaction trial-and-error. Few adopt the observational learning paradigm (OLP) based on tactile signals during human work. The former has problems such as low efficiency, high cost, and potential damage to itself or the environment, which limits its application in complex and high-precision tasks. The latter can collect high-quality tactile datasets when humans perform tasks, simulate the tactile perception perspective in human work, and enable the model to master task execution methods by “observing human work logic”. This paradigm is similar to “observational learning” pointed out in social learning theory. It is expected to improve model training efficiency, reduce training costs, and promote the intelligent process of robots assisted by E-skins. However, this research direction is affected by the limitations of current E-skins technology and DL model development, facing many challenges. Although a large number of powerful E-skins have been reported in the past decade, they still have obvious deficiencies in conformality, scalability, and multimodal perception capabilities. At the same time, the development ideas and technical paths of DL models for tactile perception are also limited by the difficulty of obtaining high-quality and large-scale tactile datasets, resulting in a slow progress. I am interested in the research direction of “integration of E-skins and DL” and hope to solve the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer of tactile intelligence from humans to machines. I plan to explore and develop E-skins suitable for both humans and humanoid robots, integrate learning algorithms, and construct an OLP based on tactile signals during human work with the help of DL methods such as transfer learning, so as to provide ideas for promoting the intelligent application of E-skins in the robot field.

High conformality: Achieving cross-domain knowledge transfer of tactile intelligence from humans to machines requires E-skins to be applicable to both human and machine surfaces, which puts forward high requirements for the conformality of E-skins. At the same time, high conformality helps E-skins obtain tactile information on complex curved surfaces more comprehensively and improve the accuracy and resolution of signals. However, most E - skins reported so far are prepared by traditional methods such as planar arrays and monolithic integration, which limits the improvement of conformality and hinders the application of E-skins. Easy scalability: Good scalability can reduce customization costs and improve application development efficiency. However, most current E-skins rely on fixed-size integrated designs or use single structures that are difficult to splice, making it difficult to flexibly adjust the size of the sensing area according to needs, which hinders the update and iteration process of intelligent applications of E-skins. Multimodal perception: Building E-skins that can perceive multiple modalities is of far-reaching significance in simulating more realistic and natural human tactile perception and improving system robustness. However, most E-skins reported at present only have the sensing modality of pressure perception, which greatly limits the application potential of E-skins in the robot field. In my undergraduate graduation project, I initially explored the design and production of E-skins. Through modular design and structural innovation, I developed four types of E-skins: traditional monolithic type, back-expanded type, bandage type, and wristwatch type. Their conformality, scalability, and multimodal perception capabilities show a gradually increasing trend. At the same time, I accumulated proficiently mastered skills such as virtual simulation modeling and 3D printing.

Its advantage lies in reducing tria-and-error costs and improving learning efficiency. Currently, this theory has been widely applied in AI model training: In the language field, large language models represented by the GPT series achieve semantic generalization by observing human language samples; In the painting field, models such as Imagine Art complete creation by learning human paintings, and all have achieved remarkable results. Applying observational learning to the training of tactile intelligent models and constructing an OLP based on tactile signals during human work is expected to have a variety of positive impacts on intelligent robots assisted by flexible E-skins: Improve the scale and quality of datasets. Collecting data during human operations can avoid complex motion simulation of robots, and large-scale data can be obtained more simply, at low cost and efficiently. At the same time, human operations are more flexible and accurate, so the obtained data is more accurate and has more significant features. Enhance the flexibility and information security of model training. This training mode supports flexible training and deployment of small models, which can effectively reduce the risk of data leakage. Improve the generalization ability of the model. It is beneficial for machines to extract abstract knowledge such as task execution patterns and strategies, and then realize creative learning and application. With the rapid development of machine learning and neural networks, various mature models continue to emerge, laying a good research foundation for constructing an OLP based on tactile signals during human work. Specifically, existing paradigms and open-source models, such as transfer learning and Transformer models, can be utilized. Then, based on the dataset of tactile signals during human work, deep learning engineering frameworks (such as PyTorch and TensorFlow) are used to fine-tune the models in a targeted manner, so that the models can accurately learn behavior patterns and features related to touch, thereby realizing the training and optimization of tactile intelligent models based on the OLP. In my undergraduate graduation project, I initially explored the construction method of deep learning engineering frameworks and proficiently mastered the use of TensorFlow preprocessing library. To build an intelligent E-skin application for pulse diagnosis, I simulated the pulse taking process and collected 5 types of pressure signals: pulse signal (PS), noise signal (NS), constant force signal (CF), random force signal (RF), and transient force signal (TF), with a total of 209 frames of data. A one dimensional convolutional neural network was built with the help of the TensorFlow preprocessing library to achieve accurate classification of the signals, and the accuracy rate reached 93%.

Believe it or not, it was the tale of a man from Shenzhen who spent 160,000 yuan to adopt a dog that gave me the confidence and determination to commit to this research. In 2021, I had just enrolled in university, still a young girl with equal enthusiasm and curiosity for all research directions—like an undifferentiated somatic cell. I kept up my habit of exploring a wide range of topics, and it was during this time that I first learned about the field of flexible electronics. It was also then that I came across the story of that man from Shenzhen. Spending 160,000 yuan on an elderly dog? If he wasn’t a wealthy person, I thought, he must be crazy. This seemingly absurd yet true story was published in major magazines, including People Magazine. Click and read the original article here:《被拍卖的柴犬登登，以及它经历的荒诞与良善》 I learned the full story: Dengdeng was a Shiba Inu who had lived in a pet boarding school for most of its life. Its owner had left it there for boarding and then abandoned it. Over the seven years after being abandoned, Dengdeng was always well-cared for by the school. However, when it turned eight, the school could no longer keep it—partly because senior dogs require more comprehensive care, and partly because the school could not afford its high living expenses. Dengdeng had to find a new owner through a public auction, making it the first dog in China to be adopted via such a public bidding process and attracting widespread attention. Mr. Shu, the man from Shenzhen, was an ordinary office worker. He worried that Dengdeng—already in the spotlight—might end up being bought by profit-driven companies or organizations, which would fail to provide it with proper care. To give Dengdeng, a dog that carried the kindness and love of many, the life it deserved, Mr. Shu patiently and rationally raised his bid dozens of times before finally winning the auction and becoming Dengdeng’s rightful new owner. After reading the story, I couldn’t calm down for a long time. Back then, I still couldn’t understand why an ordinary person would spend 160,000 yuan on an old dog. How could he be sure he was the most suitable person to adopt Dengdeng? What if someone more caring could give it a happier life if he hadn’t won the bid? Moreover, 160,000 yuan could do so much for an ordinary person—yet he had spent it all on adopting a dog. I thought it was such a waste. What I didn’t realize at the time, though, was that the spirit of the story—“If you hope for something to happen, stop waiting for others to make it come true. The person who wishes for it is the most suitable one to achieve it”—had taken root in my heart and would continue to influence me. Forming a Bond with Flexible Electronics Fueled by curiosity and enthusiasm for flexible electronics, I soon contacted Professor Guochuanfei, hoping he would guide my undergraduate research. From my words, he could tell that I had chosen this field simply because it “sounded fun.” I think he was right, but I didn’t mind. After all, aren’t many passions born from that initial “want to try” excitement? Maybe one day, I would truly want to become a researcher in flexible electronics. During my first year in the research group, I was completely immersed in the joy of exploring something new. I assisted senior students and research fellows with various experiments and participated in competitions. Amid my busy schedule, I also created a variety of works to express my imaginative ideas about flexible electronics. Confusion at the Crossroads The challenge came when I was about to start my graduation project in my third year of university—a critical time when I had to decide my path after graduation. Unlike many of my peers, I hesitated for a long time. That sweltering summer was filled with endless thinking.
